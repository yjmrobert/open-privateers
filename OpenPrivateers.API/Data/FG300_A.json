  "Description": "The FG300 Armored Frigate fits the role of a tank. It has significantly higher armor than other frigates. Since it fights in the Front row, it offers some protection to the other ships of its fleet. It can be especially useful if paired with healers. Please note however that it is likely that the FG-300 Armored Frigate will most likely be destroyed in battle, but it will absorb damage that would ordinarily have gone to other, more valuable ships.",
